* Current state:<2015-11-09 Mon>
Right now it's all in a sub-sub-subfolder. Need to:
** DONE Restructure directory to segregate scripts
** DONE Better build system to segregate .o's etc
** TODO Top level library
** TODO Consolidate DOFMAP data structure
   Do I want a C-struct dofmap? Or should I keep it as just arrays.
   I want it to stay super-simple.
   What would even go in a struct?
   
   -- ALso, I said graphs are un-oredered, but how do I associate output DOFMAPS??
   -- Might just have to order it...
   -- The output should be unassociated from the edge, since you can reuse an edge
   -- for multiple kernels. The kernel implies the output DOFMAP. even though 
   -- I didn't want kerngen to specifically think about hypergraphs. Should it?
   -- 

** TODO _kerngen_ needs to auto-make the data structure. 
   - kernel.h should be part of kerngen
** TODO Write _Husker_ to auto-wrap the kernels. 

* Roadmap:
* TODO Peridynamic states
We want to be able to handle $\nu \neq \nicefrac{1}{4}$. The library
shouldn't need too much more structure.
** DONE New graph structure:
   - (1) -> 2,3,4,5
   - One way directed (only matters that Hu's on first)
   - variable length hyperedge
** TODO Kerngen needs a syntax for variable-length inputs
** TODO Reading up on that Silling 2007 paper
** TODO Unit tests!
*** TODO Uniaxial extension, Biaxial, shear w/no damage
*** TODO Notched crack growth
*** TODO Plate w/ circle crack nucleation

* TODO Implement SPH Model
** TODO Implement shape function routines
** TODO Start with lid-driven cavity and coutte flow
** TODO Coupling with solid models: handling of multiple graphs and node-types

* TODO Microstructure model
** TODO Generation of rock microstruture
** TODO Fast and loose: Make a vornoi tessalation with scipy, assign material properties
   - If a bond crosses one of them, it gets a cementous strength
