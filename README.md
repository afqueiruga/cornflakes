Intro
-----

Cornflakes is a simple serial library for assembling
vectors and matrices from the kernels created by kerngen.
It's meant for super-quick prototyping for small problems
allowing for interactivity and inspection of the matrices,
etc.

It will have a sister program that also using kerngen but
runs massively-parallel.

Requirements
------------

Kerngen in path, scipy, numpy. Output is to vtk files.
