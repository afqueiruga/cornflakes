 * This is a serial library for generic hypergraphs. 
 * The edges of the hypergraph are meant to represent a computation,
 * and the vertices are mappings to DOFs of data to be collected from
 * the global data structures to the local computation kernel.
 * 
 * The is _NO_ geometric information associated with the graphs, they 
 * are a superset of meshes. Vertices of the graphs do not need to be 
 * a nodal-vertex-point-thingy, and hyperedges don't need to an 
 * edge/face/cell/element/w/e
 * 
 * This data structure is meant to stay on a single processor. The 
 * distribution will be handled by a second c module that converts to
 * METIS/SCOTCH style data structures adjancy information, and then 
 * redistributes the union of all the hypergraphs.

 *  0  1  2 ... Nv-1  Nv Nv+1 ... Nv+Ne-1
 * V0 V1 V2     VNv   E0  E1        ENe
