* Current state:<2015-11-09 Mon>
Right now it's all in a sub-sub-subfolder. Need to:
** TODO Restructure directory to segregate scripts
** TODO Better build system to segregate .o's etc
** TODO Top level library
** TODO Consolidate DOFMAP data structure
** TODO _kerngen_ needs to auto-make the data structure. 
   - kernel.h should be part of kerngen
** TODO Write _Husker_ to auto-wrap the kernels. 

* Roadmap:
* TODO Peridynamic states
We want to be able to handle $\nu \neq \nicefrac{1}{4}$. The library
shouldn't need too much more structure.
** TODO New graph structure:
   - (1) -> 2,3,4,5
   - One way directed (only matters that Hu's on first)
   - variable length hyperedge
** TODO Reading up on that Silling 2007 paper

* TODO Implement SPH Model
** TODO Implement shape function routines
** TODO Start with lid-driven cavity and coutte flow
** TODO Coupling with solid models: handling of multiple graphs and node-types

* TODO Microstructure model
** TODO Generation of rock microstruture
