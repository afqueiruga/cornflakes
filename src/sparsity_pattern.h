  /* Analysis 
     We need to minimize memory reallocations and copies.
     We know N, but we don't know nnz, or nnz per row.
     nnz per row is small, O(1) e.g. 9, 21, etc = O(row)
     Need to insert J into I in O(1) time. 
     - Unsorted check is O(row)
     - Insert in order is O(log(row)) + O(row) for an array
     - Insert with linked lists needs mallocs... unless I arena it...
        It would be nnz * ( row  + malloc )
        Pro: No copies, Insert in order,
	Con: lots of mallocs, linear search time
      Best option I think
       [] ~~>x
       [] ~~> [  fixed-size payload  ][] ~~> [          ][x]
       [] ~~> [  of unsorted indices ][] ~~> [          ][x]
       And then sort them after
